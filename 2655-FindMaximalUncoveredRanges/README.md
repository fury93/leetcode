You are given�an integer n�which is the length of a 0-indexed array nums, and a 0-indexed 2D-array ranges, which is a list of sub-ranges of nums�(sub-ranges may overlap).

Each row ranges[i] has exactly 2 cells:


	ranges[i][0], which shows the start of the ith range (inclusive)
	ranges[i][1], which shows the end of the ith range (inclusive)


These ranges cover some cells of nums�and leave�some cells uncovered. Your task is to find all of the uncovered ranges with maximal length.

Return a 2D-array answer of the uncovered ranges, sorted by the starting point in ascending order.

By all of the�uncovered ranges with maximal length, we mean satisfying two conditions:


	Each uncovered cell should belong to exactly one sub-range
	There should not exist�two ranges (l1, r1) and (l2, r2) such that r1 + 1 = l2

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, ranges = [[3,5],[7,8]]
Output: [[0,2],[6,6],[9,9]]
Explanation: The ranges (3, 5) and (7, 8) are covered, so if we simplify the array nums to a binary array where 0 shows an uncovered cell and 1 shows a covered cell, the array becomes [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0] in which we can observe that the ranges (0, 2), (6, 6) and (9, 9) aren't covered.


Example 2:

Input: n = 3, ranges = [[0,2]]
Output: []
Explanation: In this example, the whole of the array nums is covered and there are no uncovered cells so the output is an empty array.


Example 3:

Input: n = 7, ranges = [[2,4],[0,3]]
Output: [[5,6]]
Explanation: The ranges (0, 3) and (2, 4) are covered, so if we simplify the array nums to a binary array where 0 shows an uncovered cell and 1 shows a covered cell, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,0,0] in which we can observe that the range (5, 6) is uncovered.


�
Constraints:


	1 <= n <=�109
	0 <= ranges.length <= 106
	ranges[i].length = 2
	0 <= ranges[i][j] <= n - 1
	ranges[i][0] <=�ranges[i][1]
