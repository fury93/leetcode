Given three integers, k, digit1, and digit2, you want to find the smallest integer that is:


	Larger than k,
	A multiple of k, and
	Comprised of only the digits digit1 and/or digit2.


Return the smallest such integer. If no such integer exists or the integer exceeds the limit of a signed 32-bit integer (231 - 1), return -1.

 
Example 1:

Input: k = 2, digit1 = 0, digit2 = 2
Output: 20
Explanation:
20 is the first integer larger than 2, a multiple of 2, and comprised of only the digits 0 and/or 2.


Example 2:

Input: k = 3, digit1 = 4, digit2 = 2
Output: 24
Explanation:
24 is the first integer larger than 3, a multiple of 3, and comprised of only the digits 4 and/or 2.


Example 3:

Input: k = 2, digit1 = 0, digit2 = 0
Output: -1
Explanation:
No integer meets the requirements so return -1.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= k <= 1000
	0 <= digit1 <= 9
	0 <= digit2 <= 9
