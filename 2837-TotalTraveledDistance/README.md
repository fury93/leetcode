Table: Rides

+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |

ride_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains ride id, user id, and traveled distance.


Write a solution to calculate the distance traveled by each user. If there is a user who hasn't completed any rides, then their distance should be considered as 0. Output the user_id, name and total traveled distance.

Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | name    |
+---------+---------+
| 17      | Addison |
| 14      | Ethan   |
| 4       | Michael |
| 2       | Avery   |
| 10      | Eleanor |
+---------+---------+
Rides table:
+---------+---------+----------+
| ride_id | user_id | distance |
+---------+---------+----------+
| 72      | 17      | 160      |
| 42      | 14      | 161      |
| 45      | 4       | 59       |
| 32      | 2       | 197      |
| 15      | 4       | 357      |
| 56      | 2       | 196      |
| 10      | 14      | 25       |
+---------+---------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | name    | traveled distance |
+---------+---------+-------------------+
| 2       | Avery   | 393               |
| 4       | Michael | 416               |
| 10      | Eleanor | 0                 |
| 14      | Ethan   | 186               |
| 17      | Addison | 160               |
+---------+---------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
-  User id 2 completed two journeys of 197 and 196, resulting in a combined travel distance of 393.
-  User id 4 completed two journeys of 59 and 357, resulting in a combined travel distance of 416.
-  User id 14 completed two journeys of 161 and 25, resulting in a combined travel distance of 186.
-  User id 16 completed only one journey of 160.
-  User id 10 did not complete any journeys, thus the total travel distance remains at 0.
Returning the table orderd by user_id in ascending order.
