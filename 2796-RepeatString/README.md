Write code that enhances all strings such that you can call the string.replicate(x) method on any string and it will return repeated string x times.

Try to implement it without using the built-in method string.repeat.

 
Example 1:

Input: str = "hello", times = 2
Output: "hellohello"
Explanation: "hello" is repeated 2 times


Example 2:

Input: str = "code", times = 3
Output: "codecodecode"
Explanation: "code" is repeated 3 times


Example 3:

Input: str = "js", times = 1
Output: "js"
Explanation: "js" is repeated 1 time


 
Constraints:


	1 <= str.length, times <= 105
