Given a string s and an integer k, return the number of substrings in s of length k with no repeated characters.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "havefunonleetcode", k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings they are: 'havef','avefu','vefun','efuno','etcod','tcode'.


Example 2:

Input: s = "home", k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice k can be larger than the length of s. In this case, it is not possible to find any substring.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 104
	s consists of lowercase English letters.
	1 <= k <= 104
